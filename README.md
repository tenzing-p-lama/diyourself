# diyourself-capstone

## Overview

DIYourself is a one-stop shop for DIY project plans you can access for free and also contribute to.

### Problem

If you have ever decided to indulge yourself in a DIY project, went online in search for project plans you could use or even just as inspiration for your unique projects, you would have noticed that there isn't one website where you could find everything you need; instead you would have to search multiple different websites and watch multiple youtube videos to find one that you can work with, using the tools you already own.
This website is meant to solve that problem and be the one place where you can find a variety of project plans you can use regardless of what tools you have.

### User Profile
